        <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
        <p>
          It's quite simple: if you want to use Clojure in your day-to-day work, we can help you. Although
          learning is a complex process, that requires more effort from the party that learns.
        </p>

        <p>
          Throughout a year, we'll establish Bi-weekly Google Hangouts anyone can participate, and some local
          meetups in Munich, where we'll be moving from the most basic Functional Programming idioms to more ana
          more complex things. You're not required to be in Munich to participate. We'll do our best to make
          all material available for remote participants.
        </p>

        <h2>Why a Year?</h2>
        <p>
          From what we've seen so far, thematic meetups are great for supporting an existing knowledge and giving
          a quick overview for a topic. Although it's hard to build a solid foundation without asking people to
          make a long-term commitment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Year is a good timespan for learning something new, especially if you have a lot going on. Having some
          people enthusiastic about the same subject will help you to get moving quicker, since there's always
          someone to answer questions and discuss things with.
        </p>

        <h2>How can I participate?</h2>
        <p>
          We're finalising a course at the moment, and will publish a program here. If you think you're
          interested, just drop a line to <a href="mailto:alex@clojurewerkz.org">Alex</a>. We'll get in touch
          with you as soon as we launch the program.
