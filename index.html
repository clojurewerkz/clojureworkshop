        <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
        <p>
          It's quite simple: if you want to use Clojure in your day-to-day work, we can help you. Although
          learning is a complex process, that requires more effort from the party that learns.
        </p>

        <p>
          Throughout a year, we'll establish Bi-weekly Google Hangouts anyone can participate, and some local
          meetups in Munich, where we'll be moving from the most basic Functional Programming idioms to more ana
          more complex things. You're not required to be in Munich to participate. We'll do our best to make
          all material available for remote participants.
        </p>

        <h2>Which Languages are Going to be Covered?</h2>
        <p>
          We'll be going through Clojure and Haskell. Primary goal is to let you become a professional Clojure
          programmer, but since Haskell is an awesome language and is fun to learn and play with, we're going
          to be covering Haskell as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clojure is easy to learn and has an amazing tooling, which suits pretty much any task: front-end, web,
          backend development, data processing and manipulation.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, Haskell is a Pure Functional Programming language, and has many concepts, such as
          Purity, Laziness, Pattern Matching, Partial Function Evaluation and more, which are kind of underrepresented
          in other languages, even though they're available. It's just so much easier to learn those through Haskell,
          and start using same concepts elsewhere.
        </p>

        <h2>Why a Year?</h2>
        <p>
          Year is a good timespan for learning something new, especially if you have a lot going on. Having some
          people enthusiastic about the same subject will help you to get moving quicker, since there's always
          someone to answer questions and discuss things with.
        </p>
        <p>
          A year will be broken to 8-week semesters (rougly 2 months) with 1 month break between semesters.
          This will let you schedule things accordingly, and catch up on things you couldn't find a time for
          during the study period. This idea was taken from Coursera courses, and seems to work very well for
          long-time learning.
        </p>

        <h2>How can I participate?</h2>
        <p>
          We're finalising a course at the moment, and will publish a program here. If you think you're
          interested, just drop a line to <a href="mailto:alex@clojurewerkz.org">Alex</a>. We'll get in touch
          with you as soon as we launch the program.
